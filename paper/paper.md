# Citation Typing Ontology annotation

You can use CiTO annotations, as explained in [this BioHackathon Europe 2021 write up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-metadata/main/doc/elixir_biohackathon2021/paper.md) and [this CiTO Pilot](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/cito).
Using this template, you can cite an article and indicate why you cite that article, for instance DisGeNET-RDF [@citesAsAuthority:Queralt2016].

Possible CiTO typing annotation include:

* citesAsDataSource: when you point the reader to a source of data which may explain a claim
* usesDataFrom: when you reuse somehow (and elaborate on) the data in the cited entity
* usesMethodIn
* citesAsAuthority
* discusses
* extends
* agreesWith
* disagreesWith
